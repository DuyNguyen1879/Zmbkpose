 Very important thinks to do (I think):
 ----------------------------------
  * "curl" is used for download off mailbox backup  via http from zimbra.
   Restore is too via "curl", but zimbra can fall down on a memory limit
    problem when uses big files. 
   Options: download little files in backup, or split the backup for 
    upload. What you think


 Things that I think may be useful:
 ----------------------------------
  * Add option for backup distribution list only
  * Restore on another mailbox account
